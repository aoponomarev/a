# Process: GitHub Workspace & Issues Integration

> **Context**: Protocol for delegating tasks to GitHub Copilot Workspace and managing issues via Cursor.
> **SSOT**: `INTEGRATION_GITHUB_WORKSPACE.md`

## 1. Issue Creation via Cursor

When a task is identified that can be handled autonomously:
1. Use `gh issue create` with the `--template "ai-task.yml"` flag.
2. **Mandatory**: Include links to relevant skills in the `skills-core/` directory.
3. **Label**: Always add the `workspace-ready` label.

### Command Example:
```bash
gh issue create --title "[AI] Add telemetry to MCP" --body-file issue_body.md --label "workspace-ready"
```

## 2. Skills Visibility (Submodule)

- All core skills are located in `skills-core/`.
- **Rule**: When referencing skills in code headers or issues, use the path `skills-core/...` to ensure visibility for both local and cloud agents.
- **Legacy Support**: Paths starting with `a/skills/` are still valid for local search but should be migrated to `skills-core/` over time.

## 3. GitHub Workspace Flow

1. **Trigger**: Open the created issue in GitHub browser.
2. **Action**: Click "Open in Workspace".
3. **Review**: Validate the plan generated by Workspace against our `.cursorrules`.
4. **Handoff**: Once PR is created, use Cursor to perform the final local review and merge.

## 4. CI/CD Constraints

- **Quality Check**: Every PR triggers `.github/workflows/quality-check.yml`.
- **Failure**: If CI fails, the agent must fix the syntax errors before the PR can be reviewed.
